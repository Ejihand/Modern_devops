Many developers of NGS tools prefer to use Linux as the operating
system for their works. To use these tools (e.g. BWA, Bowtie, and
SAMTOOLS) users need to have a good level of proficiency in Linux.
However, to our knowledge, most biologists who need to work with
NGS are unfamiliar with the operating system and require at least a
gentle introduction on this topic for them to better understand commonly used commands in Linux. Otherwise, they need to juggle with
two difficulties while learning NGS tools; (i) the general Linux features
and (ii) the new tools that they need to master. The aim of this chapter is to remove the first difficulty associated with familiarizing oneself
with the Linux system so that users can concentrate on understanding
NGS tools. It is not possible to cover all aspects of Linux but the intention here is for users to be able to navigate the rest of the chapters
with ease. For users who are already familiar with Linux, they may
skip this chapter and go directly to Chapter 3 on sequence qualityn
